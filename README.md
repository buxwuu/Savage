Description of the project:
We want to create a text-based adventure game that allows you to log in when you want to play and remembers your score, progress, and username. “It’s easy to dismiss text adventures as the relics of a bygone age," says Bob Bates, a famous American computer games designer who helped create interactive fiction games through a famous company he founded called Challenge, Inc. Many people love how simple, easy, and fun these interactive fiction text-based games are to play.  They bring back nostalgic memories and remind many people of their childhood. However, Bates claims that there's more to it than just the nostalgia. He says, “I hope that will be the future. I'd like to make more games like this. I love the genre. It's fun to make. It’s fun to play. No, I don’t think of it as just a nostalgia thing.” Bates is proof that there are still people out there that want to keep text-based adventure games alive. With our project, we want to appeal to these gaming consumers that have an interest in this simple, yet incredibly fun genre of gaming.

Vision Statement for Savage:
Make a fun text-based adventure game that saves your score and progress between sessions to a username, while learning how to work efficiently and cohesively on a team of six through standard software development methodologies and tools like agile and git.

Motivation:
As a team who loves to play games and we would love the chance to develop our own. Although it seems quite straightforward, we think there will be many fun challenges coming up ahead (like learning SQL, HTML, agile, git, and doing many backend things for the first time.) It may seem simple on the surface, but we expect it to get complex underneath when we begin offering many choices at each stage of the game and saving progress and scores in a username database.

Risks:
We don’t know SQL or HTML very well.
Most of us have never made a text based game before.
Finding times to meet.

Risk Mitigation Plan:
Study: review the coding languages as much as we can.
Look to guidance from upperclassmen and people who have made text based games before.
Have everyone send each other their weekly schedules and create a fixed time to meet at regular intervals.

Version Control:
We will be using GitHub.

Development Method:
We will follow the agile method because with our busy schedules, it would be best.  This way we can continually check our code to make sure it works and do it in little steps instead of just banking that it will all work in the end.

Collaboration Tool:
Group MMS text.

Proposed Architecture Propose:
C++ for the backend code, SQL for the database, and likely a command line interface for the front end.
