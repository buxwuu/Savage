Description description of the project:
A text based adventure game that allows you to log in when you want to play and remembers your score and username.

“It’s easy to dismiss text adventures as the relics of a bygone age.” -Bob Bates
However, many people love how they are simple and easy to play.  They bring back nostalgic memories and remind people of their childhood.
 
 “I hope that will be the future. I'd like to make more games like this. I love the genre. It's fun to make. It’s fun to play. No, I don’t think of it as just a nostalgia thing.” -Bob Bates

Bates is proof that there are still people out there that keep text based adventure games alive and this is the consumer base that we will be appealing to. 

Vision Statement:
To work together as a cohesive well functioning team, in order to accomplish the task.  Take this project seriously, improve our coding, communication, social skills and get a good grade.

Motivation:
As a team who loves to play games and we would love the chance to develop our own.  Along with this, we think that this would be a straightforward, yet challenging project to do. 

Risks:
We don’t know SQL or HTML very well.
Most of us have never made a text based game before.
Finding times to meet.

Risk Mitigation Plan:
Study: review the coding languages as much as we can.
Look to guidance from upperclassmen and people who have made text based games before.
Have everyone send each other their weekly schedules.

Version Control:
We will be using GitHub.

Development Method:
We will follow the agile method because with our busy schedules, it would be best.  This way we can continually check our code to make sure it works and do it in little steps instead of just banking that it will all work in the end.

Collaboration Tool:
Group text


Proposed Architecture Propose:
C++ for the backend code, sql for the database, and likely a command line interface for the front end
