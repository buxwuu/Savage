Over the course of the semester, we have been building a text-based adventure game. Of the many features we've decided to include \
in this game, three features that we will be testing for Milestone 5 is:

1. Being able to create/login to your personal user account.
2. Be able to log back in without creating a new account.
3. Checks to make sure your username is valid.
